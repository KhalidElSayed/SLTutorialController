# SLTutorialController

SLTutorialController is an Objective-C class that manages the user's progression through a linear tutorial. We built it while adding a tutorial to a game we made for a client.

To learn what it can be used for, and how to use it, check out the [blog post](http://blog.secretlab.com.au/2012/06/04/sltutorialcontroller/ "SLTutorialController on Secret Lab's blog").

Please open an issue on GitHub if you'd like to make a request.
